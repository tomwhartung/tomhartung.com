    Two Toms From Virginia
   </h2>
   <p>
    As a Tom who grew up in Virginia, I have always held Thomas Jefferson in
     very high regard.
    His interest in both science and art, and his authoring of both
     <span class="document-title">The Declaration of Independence</span>
     and the
     <span class="document-title">
      Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom</span>,
     were just a few of his accomplishments fueling my admiration.
   </p>
   <p>
    Somehow this admiration for Jefferson led to an unconscious
     dislike for Alexander Hamilton.
    This prejudice was certainly more of a presumption than a conscious
     decision on my part.
   </p>
   <p>
    Today, I'm quite sure this negative opinion of Hamilton was due to the
     <q class="slang"><a href="/about" title="About this site">corn-pone
       effect</a></q>
     of growing up in Richmond, Virginia.
   </p>

    <span class="document-title">Alexander Hamilton</span>, by Ron Chernow
   </h2>
   <p>
    While shopping for books online one day, I saw some ads for
     Alexander Hamilton T-shirts, and wondered
     why he was suddenly so popular.
    Why were there no ads for Thomas Jefferson and
     George Washington T-shirts as well?
   </p>
   <p>
    Of course it's because of the musical about his life.
    Digging deeper, I learned the basis for the musical is the book
     <a href="https://amzn.to/2QsFewc" target="_blank">
      <span class="document-title">Alexander Hamilton</span></a>
     by Ron Chernow.
   </p>
   <p>
    Intrigued, I bought the book, and
     <em><u>reading it changed my life!</u></em>
   </p>
   <h4 class="mui--text-center">A Prologue With a Challenge</h4>
   <p>
    In the prologue to Alexander Hamilton's biography, Ron Chernow muses about the
     poor impression many have of Hamilton.
    He attributes this to the fact that other Founding Fathers &mdash;
     such as Jefferson and John Adams &mdash; lived considerably longer lives.
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    For many years after the duel, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and
     other political enemies had taken full advantage of their eloquence and
     longevity to spread defamatory anectdotes about Hamilton,
     who had been condemned to everlasting silence.

   <p>
    What a great way to start a book!
   </p>
   <p>
    One thing I know for sure is that having a pre-formed,
     negative bias toward someone can lead to ignorance &mdash;
     and this gives me major
     <span class="slang">fomo</span>.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Jump to the notes on this page">[1]</a></sup>
    There's always another side, another perspective, and any
     life-long learner worth their salt needs to be open to
     whatever information is available.
   </p>
   <h4 class="mui--text-center">The Book Is a Big One</h4>
   <p>
    Ron Chernow is a thorough researcher and an entertaining writer.
    Alexander Hamilton's biography is 731 pages long,
     so reading it takes some time.
    Thankfully, Chernow's organizational ability and writing style
     are superb.
   </p>
   <p>
    Most of the 43 chapters run 10-15 pages, with a few of them running
     into the 20s.
    By breaking the volume down into easily-read nuggets, Chernow
     keeps things interesting, making it difficult to put the book down.
   </p>
   <h4 class="mui--text-center">My Favorite FF Biography!</h4>
   <p>
    I enjoyed Ron Chernow's book so much, I bought and read biographies of
     these other Founding
     Fathers:

    Thomas Jefferson is missing from this
     list<sup><a href="#notes" title="Jump to the notes on this page">[2]</a></sup>
     because I feel I already know enough about him, at least
     for now, from my days in Ole Virginny.
    If you'd like to learn about Jefferson, the film
    <a href="https://amzn.to/2EjPdwB"  class="document-title" target="_blank">
     Thomas Jefferson</a>
     by Ken Burns is a great place to start.
    If you already know a lot about Jefferson and want
     to take a deeper dive, I recommend
     <a href="https://amzn.to/2Egktwk" class="document-title" target="_blank">
      Jefferson Himself: The Personal Narrative of a Many-Sided American</a>
     by Bernard Mayo.
   </p>
   <p>
    After some consideration, I believe Ron Chernow's
     <a href="https://amzn.to/2QsFewc" class="document-title" target="_blank">
      Alexander Hamilton
     </a>
     to be the best of all of these.
   </p>
   <h4 class="mui--text-center">Why It's the Best</h4>
   <p>
    George Washington's biography, also by Ron Chernow, is
     similarly well-written.
    But Washington's life &mdash; when compared to Hamilton's &mdash;
     is quite frankly rather boring.
   </p>
   <p>
    The other biographies are great as well, but in my mind
     they all pale &mdash; albeit slightly &mdash; when
     compared to Hamilton's biography.
    This is because Hamilton, who was the youngest of the Founding
     Fathers and the only one not born in the colonies, simply
     had a more interesting life.
   </p>
   <p>
    Naturally, the fact that
     <span class="document-title">Alexander Hamilton</span>
     by Chernow completely changed my
     perspective of Hamilton &mdash; and enabled me to overcome my
     fear of thick books in the process &mdash; adds to my reasons
     for loving this book.
   </p>
   <h2 class="mui--text-center">Hamilton <em><u>and</u></em> Jefferson</h2>
   <p>
    Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson were very different,
     both superficially and beneath the surface.
   </p>
   <p>
    Hamilton
     <a href="https://www.artsyvisions.com/visions/story/0060-person-alexander_hamilton"
        title="Image of Alexander Hamilton's personality at ArtsyVisions.com"
        target="_blank">was extremely decisive</a>,
     and his world was New York City, commerce, the army, and law.
    In contrast, Jefferson
      <a href="https://www.artsyvisions.com/visions/story/0040-person-thomas_jefferson"
         title="Image of Thomas Jefferson's personality at ArtsyVisions.com"
         target="_blank">was extremely idealistic</a>,
      and his world was rural Virginia, architecture, science, art, and philosophy.
   </p>
   <p>
    They had vastly different views for the design of the government of
     the new nation, leading many to assume they fought all the time.
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-breakout">
    Thinking in terms of
     <q>Hamilton <em><u><b>or</b></u></em> Jefferson</q>
     blinds people to seeing how America is,
     to a large extent, the result of
     <q>Hamilton <em><u><b>and</b></u></em> Jefferson</q>.
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Although Hamilton and Jefferson had their differences,
     the net result of them both working to create a new
     nation is they kept each other in check &mdash; rather
     like Dana Scully and Fox Mulder on
     <a href="https://www.artsyvisions.com/visions/story/0050-pairs-x_files-mulder_and_scully"
        title="Spiritual portraits of Mulder and Scully on ArtsyVisions.com"
        target="_blank">
      The X-Files.</a>
   </p>
   <h4 class="mui--text-center">Scully and Mulder?</h4>
   <p>
    Alexander Hamilton was like the X-Files' Dana Scully in that
     he was very realistic and interested mainly in facts, rules,
     and honoring conventions.
    He respected authority and considered himself
     worthy of being in charge.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thomas Jefferson was like the X-Files' Fox Mulder in that
     he was very idealistic and interested mainly in principles,
     patterns, and new ideas.
    He respected only the authority of the individual over himself and
     sought to minimize the purview of government.
   </p>
   <p>
    The fictional characters from the X-Files show how two people
     who have little in common can put their differences aside and
     work toward a common goal.
   </p>
   <h4 class="mui--text-center">Monarchy or Anarchy?</h4>
   <p>
    Alexander Hamilton feared anarchy &mdash; a fear fueled by the violence
     of the French Revolution.
    He wanted to create a new nation powerful enough to hold its own
     with &mdash; and against, if need be &mdash; the powerful European
     countries of the day.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thomas Jefferson feared a monarchy &mdash; a fear fueled by
     the new nation's recent conflict with Britain.
    He wanted to create a new nation that put the rights of the
     individual first and foremost &mdash; constrained only by the equal
     rights of others.
   </p>
   <p>
    Their conflicting fears, and their differences of opinion with
     regards to who is in charge, led to vastly different visions of
     the structure of the new nation's government.
   </p>
   <h2 class="mui--text-center">
    Hamilton <em><u>and</u></em> Jefferson: The Team
   </h2>
   <p>
    Just because two people are as different as night and
     day doesn't mean they hate each other.
    The friction between Hamilton and Jefferson ultimately
     found resolution in compromises made in the creation of
     America's government.
   </p>
   <p>
    Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson &mdash; like
     Mulder and Scully &mdash; wound up forming a team
     that was much greater than the sum of its parts.
   </p>
   <p>
    The end result is a system of government highly resistant to
     both Hamilton's fear of mob violence
     and Jefferson's fear of future tyrants.

      Interestingly, Ron Chernow's biography of Hamilton
       has a lot about Jefferson.
      The index contains over an entire
       column &mdash; half a page &mdash; of entries for Jefferson.
      Not all of what Chernow says about him is positive, but
       I can easily understand someone having a bit of bias in this area.
