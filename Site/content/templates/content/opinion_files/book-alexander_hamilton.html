    As a Tom who grew up in Virginia, I have always held Thomas Jefferson in
     very high regard.
    His interest in both science and art, and his authoring of both
     <span class="document-title">The Declaration of Independence</span>
     and the
     <span class="document-title">
      Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom</span>,
     were just a few of his accomplishments fueling my admiration.
   </p>
   <p>
    Somehow this admiration for Jefferson led to an unconscious
     dislike for Alexander Hamilton.
    This prejudice was certainly more of a presumption than a conscious
     decision on my part.
   </p>
   <p>
    So in my mind, there's no doubt this negative opinion of
     Hamilton was due to the
     <q class="slang"><a href="/about" title="About this site">corn-pone
       effect</a></q>
     of growing up in Richmond, Virginia.

    <span class="document-title">Alexander Hamilton</span>, by Ron Chernow
   </h2>
   <p>
    While shopping for books online one day, I saw some ads for
     Alexander Hamilton T-shirts, and wondered
     why he was suddenly so popular.
   </p>
   <p>
    Of course it's because of the musical about his life.
    Digging deeper, I learned the basis for the musical is the book
     <a href="https://amzn.to/2QsFewc" target="_blank">
      <span class="document-title">Alexander Hamilton</span></a>
     by Ron Chernow.
   </p>
   <p>
    Intrigued, I bought the book, and
     <em><u>reading it changed my life!</u></em>
   </p>
   <h4 class="mui--text-center">A Prologue With a Challenge</h4>
   <p>
    In the prologue to Alexander Hamilton's biography, Ron Chernow muses about the
     poor impression many have of Hamilton.
    He attributes this to the fact that other Founding Fathers &mdash;
     such as Jefferson and John Adams &mdash; lived considerably longer lives.
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    For many years after the duel, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and
     other political enemies had taken full advantage of their eloquence and
     longevity to spread defamatory anectdotes about Hamilton,
     who had been condemned to everlasting silence.
    <br>

   <p>
    What a great way to start a book!
   </p>
   <p>
    One thing I know for sure is that having a pre-formed,
     negative bias toward someone can lead to ignorance &mdash;
     and this gives me major <span class="slang">fomo</span>.
    There's always another side, another perspective, and any
     life-long learner worth their salt needs to be open to
     whatever information is available.
   </p>
   <h4 class="mui--text-center">The Book Is a Big One</h4>
   <p>
    Ron Chernow is a thorough researcher and an entertaining writer.
    Alexander Hamilton's biography is 731 pages long,
     so reading it takes some time.
    Thankfully, Chernow's organizational ability and writing style
     are superb.
   </p>
   <p>
    Most of the 43 chapters run 10-15 pages, with a few of them running
     into the 20s.
    By breaking the volume down into easily-read nuggets, Chernow
     keeps things interesting, making it difficult to put the book down.
   </p>
   <h4 class="mui--text-center">My Favorite FF Biography!</h4>
   <p>
    I enjoyed Ron Chernow's book so much, I bought and read biographies of
     these other Founding
     Fathers:

    Thomas Jefferson is missing from this
     list<sup><a href="#notes" title="Jump to the notes on this page">[1]</a></sup>
     because I feel I already know enough about him, at least
     for now, from my days in Ole Virginny.
    If you'd like to learn about Jefferson, the film
    <a href="https://amzn.to/2EjPdwB"  class="document-title" target="_blank">
     Thomas Jefferson</a>
     by Ken Burns is a great place to start.
    If you already know a lot about Jefferson and want
     to take a deeper dive, I recommend

     by Bernard Mayo.
   </p>
   <p>
    After some consideration, I believe Ron Chernow's
     <a href="https://amzn.to/2QsFewc" class="document-title" target="_blank">
      Alexander Hamilton
     </a>
     to be the best of all of these.
   </p>
   <h5 class="mui--text-center">Why It's the Best</h5>
   <p>
    George Washington's biography, also by Ron Chernow, is
     similarly well-written.
    But Washington's life &mdash; when compared to Hamilton's &mdash;
     is quite frankly rather boring.
   </p>
   <p>
    The other biographies are great as well, but in my mind
     they all pale &mdash; albeit slightly &mdash; when
     compared to Hamilton's biography.
    This is because Hamilton, who was the youngest of the Founding
     Fathers and the only one not born in the colonies, simply
     had a more interesting life.
   </p>
   <p>
    Naturally, the fact that
     <span class="document-title">Alexander Hamilton</span>
     by Chernow completely changed my
     perspective of Hamilton &mdash; and enabled me to overcome my
     fear of thick books in the process &mdash; increases my
     fondness for the book.

   <h4 class="mui--text-center">
    Hamilton and Jefferson: It's the Gestalt That Matters
   </h4>
   <p>
    Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson were very different,
     both superficially and beneath the surface.
   </p>
   <p>
    Hamilton was extremely
     <a href="https://www.artsyvisions.com/visions/story/0060-person-alexander_hamilton"
        title="Image of Alexander Hamilton's personality at ArtsyVisions.com"
        target="_blank">decisive</a>,
     and his world was New York City, commerce, the army, and law.
    Jefferson was extremely
      <a href="https://www.artsyvisions.com/visions/story/0040-person-thomas_jefferson"
         title="Image of Thomas Jefferson's personality at ArtsyVisions.com"
         target="_blank">idealistic</a>,
      and his world was rural Virginia, architecture, science, art, and philosophy.
   </p>
   <p>
    They had different views for the design of the new country, making
     it easy to assume they fought all the time.
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-breakout">
    However, thinking in terms of
     <q>Hamilton <em><u>or</u></em> Jefferson</q>
     blinds people to seeing how America is the result of
     <q>Hamilton <em><u>and</u></em> Jefferson</q>.
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Certainly they fought, but the net result is they kept each
     other in check &mdash; rather like Dana Scully and Fox Mulder
     on
     <a href="https://www.artsyvisions.com/visions/story/0050-pairs-x_files-mulder_and_scully"
        title="Spiritual portraits of Mulder and Scully on ArtsyVisions.com"
        target="_blank">
      The X-Files.</a>

   </p>
   <h5 class="mui--text-center">Scully and Mulder</h5>
   <p>
    Alexander Hamilton was like Agent Scully in that he was very realistic
     and interested mainly in facts.
    He wanted to create a new nation powerful enough to hold its own
     with &mdash; and against, if need be &mdash; the powerful European
     countries of the day.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thomas Jefferson was like Agent Mulder in that he was very idealistic
     and interested mainly in principles.
    He wanted to create a new nation that put the rights of the
     individual first and foremost, constrained only by the equal
     rights of others.
   </p>
   <p>
    Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson &mdash; like
     Mulder and Scully &mdash; formed a team
     that was much greater than the sum of its parts.
   </p>
   <h5 class="mui--text-center">Monarchy Versus Anarchy</h5>
   <p>
    Hamilton feared anarchy &mdash; a fear fueled by the violence
     of the French Revolution.
    He respected authority and considered himself worthy of being in charge.
   </p>
   <p>
    Jefferson feared a monarchy &mdash; a fear fueled by the new nation's
     recent conflict with Britain.
    He respected only the authority of the individual over himself.
   </p>
   <p>
    These conflicting fears, and their differences of opinion with
     regards to who is in charge, led to vastly different visions of
     the new nation's governmental structure.
    The friction between these two very different people ultimately
     found resolution in compromises made in the creation of
     America's government.
   </p>
   <h5 class="mui--text-center">Keeping Each Other in Check</h5>
   <p>
    Certainly, once Hamilton and Jefferson got to know each other,
     they could anticipate the push-back each
     would get from the other.
    Much like Mulder and Scully, they would surely learn how to
     frame their observations and proposed plans accordingly.
   </p>
   <p>
    This enabled them to help the other understand and
     expidite approval of the suggested course of action.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    The end result is a system of government highly resistant to
     threats of mob violence &mdash; aleviating Hamilton's
     concerns &mdash; and would-be tyrants &mdash; aleviating
     Jefferson's concerns &mdash; alike.
   </p>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <p>
    I am sure that, once they got to know each other,
     Jefferson and Hamilton could anticipate the push-back each
     would get from the other.
    Much like Mulder and Scully, they would surely learn how to
     frame their observations and proposed plans accordingly.
   </p>
   <p>
    This enabled them to help the other understand and
     expidite approval of the suggested course of action.

     determined, tyranical despots.

   <h3 class="mui--text-center">From Hamilton Post on som.com</h3>
   Alexander Hamilton was born on January 11 of either 1755 or 1757, in Charlestown, the capital of the island of Nevis in the Caribbean Sea.
   <br>
   Although no one is sure which year he was born, it is certain he was illegitimate, the youngest of the seven key Founding Fathers, and the only one of that group who was born outside of the Thirteen Colonies.

   <h4>Hamilton, the Decision Maker</h4>
   Because his parents were unmarried, Alexander Hamilton and his brother James were unable to attend school at the Church of England. He supplemented the tutoring he received at a private school with reading his family's books.
   <br>
   Still a teenager, Hamilton came to America in 1772 and, after a year or so, began studying at King's College (now Columbia) in New York City. He was exposed to and soon joined the patriots' revolutionary cause, and served as one of Washington's aides de camp for four years.
   <br>
   The decisiveness that Alexander Hamilton developed during his youth — represented by the vast amount of Green in his spiritual portrait — served him well during the war, giving him courage and conviction. After the war, his strong will and keen reasoning ability led him to pursue a career in law.

   <h4>The Inevitable Push-Back</h4>
   Even as a young man, Hamilton did not find as much satisfaction in his law career. He became interested in the politics of the new nation, and his father-in-law Philip Schuyler chose him to represent New York in the Constitutional Convention in 1787.
   <br>
   Anyone who has ever been among decisive people, whether it be on a playground or in a board room, can certainly confirm Publius's observation in Federalist No. 70:

   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    Men often oppose a thing, merely because they have had no agency in planning it, or because it may have been planned by those whom they dislike.
    — Alexander Hamilton, as Publius in Federalist No. 70, The Executive Department Further Considered, March 18, 1788.
   </blockquote>

   The push-back Hamilton had been experiencing in the war and his work as a lawyer was soon to get worse, driving him to join James Madison and John Jay in writing the Federalist Papers.
   <br>
   These publications are sometimes mistakenly thought to be Hamilton's alone, because he initiated and managed the series. Ultimately Madison wrote 29 and Jay penned just 5, while the decisive and ambitious Alexander wrote 51 of them.

   <h4>Hamilton, the Realist</h4>
   Alexander Hamilton's experiences in the Revolutionary War were a driving force behind his desire for a strong Federal Government. As Washington's aide, he had seen first hand how the lack of essential supplies — food, weapons, uniforms, and even pay for the soldiers — dangerously hampered the war effort.
   <br>
   With Shay's Rebellion in 1786 and 1787, America had already experienced a militant uprising that threatened the lives of law-abiding citizens. However, in the years following the Revolutionary War the country's standing army was miniscule. And with no codified way to repay lingering debt for the war, Hamilton knew it would be very difficult to find new recruits.
   <br>
   Alexander Hamilton's prevailing realism — represented by the Yellow in his spiritual portrait — contrasts quite strongly with the idealism of Thomas Jefferson. Where Jefferson, who lived in the Virginia countryside, envisioned a rural, agrarian society, Hamilton, who lived on the island of Manhattan in New York City, foresaw large, bustling cities.
   <br>
   Hamilton's and Jefferson's different attitudes are especially evident with regards to the idea of a standing army:

   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    Let us recollect that peace or war will not always be left to our option; that however moderate or unambitious we may be, we cannot count upon the moderation, or hope to extinguish the ambition of others.
    — Alexander Hamilton, as Publius in Federalist No. 34, The Same Subject Continued: Concerning the General Power of Taxation, January 4, 1788.
   </blockquote>
   <br>
   While Jefferson thought the United States could remain neutral without a standing military, Hamilton knew this idea was dangerously unrealistic.

   <h4>Hamilton, the Meta-President</h4>
   Alexander Hamilton was never president. This is due to a number of reasons, including being illegitimate and foreign-born, his relatively young age, and his unfortunate involvement in the infamous Maria Reynolds scandal.
   <br>
   Alexander Hamilton could rightly be called a meta-president, though:
   <br>
   As a member of the Constitutional Convention he had a role in creating and defining the presidency.
   His Federalist No. 70, The Executive Department Further Considered, outlines the specific duties of the president in considerable detail.
   <br>
   As someone with a considerable amount of pull with the presidential electors, he could make or break candidates in the first few elections.
   No one dared oppose George Washington in the first two Presidential elections in 1788 and 1792. So those two terms were a done deal, and to this date, Washington has been the only president who did not belong to a political party.
   <br>
   However, when Washington refused to run for a third term, Hamilton worked behind the scenes to help John Adams get elected in 1796. Hamilton also helped Thomas Jefferson get elected President in 1800.
   <br>
   While he lived, Alexander Hamilton was more than a president, he was a meta-president.

   <h4>A Complicated Assumption</h4>
   Alexander Hamilton turned his world-class reasoning ability and fine attention to detail into superhero powers in the late 1780s, culminating in the Compromise of 1790.
   <br>
   State governments were frequently forced to fund the Revolutionary War with notes that were essentially I.O.U.s. Some people — such as farmers who were formerly soldiers and needed to buy seeds, for example — had sold their notes to speculators, often for mere cents on the dollar. And some states, such as Virginia and North Carolina, had paid off most of this debt, while other states, such as Massachusetts and South Carolina, had heavy debts left yet to pay.
   <br>
   Figuring out a way to make everyone happy in this situation was problematic:
   <br>
   Should the federal government assume the states' debts — rewarding the states that still had massive debts at the expense of the more conscientious ones?
   Should the I.O.U.s be paid off at full face value — rewarding the speculators at the expense of people like the hard-working farmer-soldiers?
   Hamilton believed the answer to both questions was Yes, and as the nation's first Secretary of the Treasury, his opinions mattered more than anyone else's. He set forth the facts and his reasoning about them in the First Report on the Public Credit, and delivered the 40,000 word document to Congress on January 9, 1790.

   <h4>More Push-Back</h4>
   Alexander Hamilton's Report on the Public Credit, presented to Congress in January of 1790, got a lot of push-back. A stalemate resulted, with House Representative James Madison and Washington's new Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson leading the opposition.
   <br>
   Just a few years prior to this, Hamilton had bemoaned the creation of political parties, and the difficulty inherent in trying to change people's opinions, once they've been formed:
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
   [N]othing could be more ill-judged than that intolerant spirit which has, at all times, characterized political parties. In politics, as in religion, it is equally absurd to aim at making proselytes by fire and sword. Heresies in either can rarely be cured by persecution.
    — Alexander Hamilton, as Publius in Federalist No. 1, General Introduction, October 27, 1787.
   </blockquote>

   <h4>Dinner Time!</h4>
   The stalemate over assumption ended on June 20, 1790, when Alexander Hamilton sat down to dinner with Thomas Jefferson and James Madison and to discuss the situation. During this famous conversation, Jefferson and Madison agreed to acquiesce on the assumption of state debts if Hamilton would agree to move the nation's capitol south from its original home in Manhattan — a city that some of Hamilton's fans actually wanted to call Hamiltonopolis.
   <br>
   With the Compromise of 1790, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison agreed to pass legislation that would become known as the Funding Act of 1790 and the Residence Act.
   <br>
   The Funding Act called for the assumption of the states' war debts by the Federal Government — and everything that went along with that. And the Residence Act called for temporarily moving the nation's capitol from its current home in New York City to Philadelphia. From there it would move again to a permanent home in Washington, D.C., a new city on the Potomac River between Maryland and Virginia.

   <h4>Party Time!</h4>
   A significant side effect of all this was the creation of America's two-party system. The process started with Jefferson's and Madison's informal Anti-Administration Party in 1789.

   Two years later, Alexander Hamilton and his supporters formed the Federalist Party. And a year after that the informal Anti-Administration Party evolved into the formal Republican Party — known to some historians as the Democratic-Republican Party, and not to be confused with today's GOP — in 1792.

   <h4>Ugly Rumors</h4>
   Some people claim that Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson actually hated each other. Although this is ultimately a matter of semantics, one might reasonably like to think the Founding Fathers were better than that.
   <br>
   Indeed, some recent accounts of their relationship paint Jefferson as a villain. However, allegations of hatred are a bit exaggerated.
   <br>
   In Thomas Jefferson's Anas he states Alexander Hamilton was honest, and honorable in all private transactions, amiable in society, and duly valuing virtue in private. This is hardly the language of a hater.
   <br>
   Likewise, when Alexander Hamilton helped Jefferson beat Aaron Burr in the fourth presidential election in 1800, he showed he had at least some respect for Jefferson. Again, this does not sound like something a hater would do.

   <h4>No Time for Hate</h4>
   When Aaron Burr forced Alexander Hamilton into their infamous duel, there is ample evidence that Hamilton intended to throw his shot away. And if Hamilton actually did throw away his shot on that fateful day, then he effectively died for refusing to hate Burr — someone who fully intended to kill him — and someone who, sadly, was successful.
   <br>
   Hate is an emotion, but Hamilton, Jefferson, and Adams were predominantly logical people. Emotions — such as those that dominated the French Revolution around this time — are the driving force behind mobs.
   <br>
   Although Alexander Hamilton, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson became political rivals, these three were nonetheless strongly united in their contempt for mob violence. It is actually the lack of hatred and predominance of reason that made the American Revolution much less bloody than the one in France.
   <br>
   Saying the Founding Fathers hated each other sounds shocking because it's hyperbole — essentially fake news — at best, a poor choice of words. If Alexander Hamilton was a more emotional person, and more likely to be a hater, the tendency to be emotional would show up as more Red in his spiritual portrait.

   <h4>About This Portrait</h4>
   This spiritual portrait is based on the biography of Alexander Hamilton by Ron Chernow. There is also an American Experience video about Hamilton's life, but Chernow's book — which inspired the musical about Hamilton — is far more comprehensive.
   <br>
   Chernow's biography of Alexander Hamilton is an excellent work, detailed and informative, well-organized and well-written, and easy to read — despite being over 700 pages long. I highly recommend it for everyone!

    Admirably, Chernow addresses common prejudices readers might bring to his subject by starting his book with this observation:</p>
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    For many years after the duel, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and
     other political enemies had taken full advantage of their eloquence and
     longevity to spread defamatory anectdotes about Hamilton,

    As the third president of the United States of America, Thomas Jefferson was the first president to be inaugurated in Washington, D.C.
   <br>
    And as the first president from the Democratic-Republican Party, Jefferson paved the way for the next three presidents. At the time they were known as just Republicans — but should not to be confused with the GOP. The Republicans of the early 1800s, led by Jefferson, James Madison (4th), James Monroe (5th), and John Quincy Adams (6th), occupied the Presidency continuously from March 4, 1801 until March 4, 1829.
   <h4>Ideally: Liberty Without Anarchy</h4>
    The vast amount of Blue in Jefferson's profile represents his strong preference for idealism. This idealism is quite obvious in his authoring the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom in 1777, an important precursor to the First Amendment to the Constitution in 1791.
   <br>
    As the following quote shows, Jefferson's idealism also enabled him to delineate the fine yet crucial distinction between too much liberty — total anarchy — and just enough:

   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    Of liberty I would say that, in the whole plenitude of its extent, it is unobstructed action according to our will. But rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others. [Emphasis added.]
     — Thomas Jefferson, in a Letter to Isaac H. Tiffany, April 4, 1819.
   </blockquote>
   <br>
    Jefferson's idealism certainly helped make the transition to the United States' new and unique system of government — once independence from Britain was attained — relatively peaceful. In contrast, the transitions of some other countries since then have been quite the opposite.
   <br>
    From France's Reign of Terror in the late 1790s to more recent conflicts such as the Arab Spring of the early 2010s, Americans were and continue to be fortunate to have individuals such as Jefferson — and the countless others he inspired — step up and make their ideals well known.
   <br>
    Surely everyone would agree that any sort of violence is the ultimate act of disrespect for the equal rights of others.
    <h4>He Just Feels Like it Sometimes</h4>
    Thomas Jefferson is famous for authoring the Declaration of Independence, but a letter he wrote to Maria Cosway in the spring of 1786 shows a strong awareness and appreciation of the psychological opposites that fans of the MBTI® call Thinking and Feeling.
   <br>
    Jefferson wrote this letter over 135 years before Carl Jung would articulate his observances in his General Description of the Types in 1923. The letter articulates — in an extremely personal and revealing manner — the distinction between the Thinking (Green) and Feeling (Red) functions playing a part in the four-letter-types created and popularized by Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers around that same time.
   <br>
    Following are some excerpts from My Head and My Heart:

   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    Seated by my fireside, solitary & sad, the following dialogue took place between my Head & my Heart:
    Head: Well, friend, you seem to be in a pretty trim.
    Heart: I am indeed the most wretched of all earthly beings. Overwhelmed with grief, every fibre of my frame distended beyond its natural powers to bear, I would willingly meet whatever catastrophe should leave me no more to feel or to fear.
    Head: These are the eternal consequences of your warmth & precipitation. This is one of the scrapes into which you are ever leading us....
    Heart: Oh, my friend! This is no moment to upbraid my foibles. I am rent into fragments by the force of my grief! ....
    Head: On the contrary I never found that the moment of triumph with you was the moment of attention to my admonitions.... Harsh therefore as the medicine may be, it is my office to administer it....
    Heart: Accordingly, Sir, this acquaintance was not the consequence of my doings. It was one of your projects which threw us in the way of it....
     — Excerpts from My Head and My Heart, a letter from Thomas Jefferson to Maria Cosway, October 12, 1786.
   </blockquote>
    Thomas Jefferson's profile shows only a very slight preference for Thinking over Feeling, and this short passage shows he took advantage of both decision-making techniques. This explains why some consider him an enigma, in that he could declare all men are created equal while tacitly condoning slavery, and even own slaves while loving at least one of them.

    <h4>Ugly Rumors</h4>
    Some people claim that Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton actually hated each other. Although this is ultimately a matter of semantics, one might reasonably like to think the Founding Fathers were better than that.
    The following quote, from Jefferson's Anas, shows he actually had genuine — albeit qualified — respect for Hamilton:

   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    Hamilton was, indeed, a singular character. Of acute understanding, disinterested, honest, and honorable in all private transactions, amiable in society, and duly valuing virtue in private life, yet so bewitched and perverted by the British example as to be under thorough conviction that corruption was essential to the government of a nation.
     — From The Anas by Thomas Jefferson, 1791-1806.
    </blockquote>
    <h4>No Time for Hate</h4>
    Thomas Jefferson's Anas are scraps of paper containing notes he left that, taken together, form a well-kept diary. Jefferson's candid opinion of Hamilton, as expressed above, makes it sound like allegations of hatred might be a bit exaggerated.
   <br>
    Hate is an emotion, but Jefferson, Hamilton, and Adams were predominantly logical people. Emotions — such as those that dominated the French Revolution around this time — are the driving force behind mobs.
   <br>
    Although Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and Alexander Hamilton became political rivals, these three were nonetheless strongly united in their contempt for mob violence. It is actually the lack of hatred and predominance of reason that made the American Revolution much less bloody than the one in France.
   <br>
    Saying the Founding Fathers hated each other sounds shocking because it's hyperbole — essentially fake news — at best, a poor choice of words. If Thomas Jefferson was a more emotional person, and more likely to be a hater, the tendency to be emotional would show up as more Red in his spiritual portrait.
    <h4>Preserving Liberty</h4>
   <br>
    Like his fellow Founding Fathers George Washington and John Adams, Jefferson realized that ignorance would mean the end of the republic:

   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    Bigotry is the disease of ignorance, of morbid minds; enthusiasm of the free and buoyant. Education & free discussion are the antidotes of both.

     — Thomas Jefferson in a letter to John Adams, August 1, 1816.
   </blockquote>
    Americans are fortunate to have a system of government created by a group of well-educated, reasonable, and sincere Founding Fathers such as Thomas Jefferson. As the third president of the United States and author of the Declaration of Independence, his contributions to the subsequent success of the nation are undeniable.

    <h4>About This Portrait</h4>
    This portrait is based on the TV Mini-Series documentary Thomas Jefferson by Ken Burns, the book Jefferson Himself: The Personal Narrative of a Many-Sided American by Bernard Mayo, and the biography of Alexander Hamilton by Ron Chernow — which actually discusses Jefferson quite a bit.
   <br>
    Like the rest of Ken Burns' films, all viewers can enjoy the TV Mini-Series documentary. Mayo's book, on the other hand, is best for readers interested in taking a deep dive into Jefferson's correspondence. For more information about Chernow's book, see the page with Alexander Hamilton's image on this site.
   <br>
    Released in 1997, the video by Ken Burns is informative and a real pleasure to watch. I highly recommend it for everyone!
