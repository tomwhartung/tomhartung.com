   <p>
    The book is in two parts.
    Part 1 defines what deep work is, and
     Part 2 details how to do more of it.

    What if I told you the technopoly has duped us into
     thinking we need to use the internet <em>else fomo</em>?

    Deep Work: Professional work performed in a state of
     distraction-free concebtration that push your cognitive
     capabilities to their limit.
    These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and
     are hard to duplicate.

   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is
     becoming increasingly <em>rare</em> at exactly the same time it is
     becoming increasingly <em>valuable</em> in our economy.
    As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make
     it the core of their working life, will thrive.

   <p>
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
     Deep work is at a severe disadvantage in a technopoly because it builds on
     values like quality, craftmanship, and mastery that are decidedly old-fashioned
     and non-technological.
     <br>
     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Deep Work by Cal Newport, p. 69.

   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    [Social networking sites] offer personalized information arriving on an
    unpredictible intermittent schedule - making them massively addictive and
    therefore capable of severely damaging your attempts to schedule and
    succeed with any act of concentration.
    <br>
    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Deep Work by Cal Newport, p. 205.
   </blockquote>
   <p>
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    But part of what makes social networking insidious is that the companies
    that profit from your attention have succeeded with a masterful marketing
    coup: convincing our culture that if you don't use their products you
    might <em>miss out</em>.

    [Cal discusses how before the internet, traditional media - books,
    newspapers, radio, film, tv - were heavily curated by the publishers.
    Using social media, anyone can publish anything without fear of an
    editor's modifications.  Examples: songs such as The Pill and Wake Up,
    Little Susie, The Hayes Code, Uhura's and Kirk's kiss, and so on.]
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    Part of what fueled social media's rapid ascent, I contend, is its ability
    to short-circuit this connection between the hard work of producing real
    value and the positive reward of having people pay attention to you. It has
    instead replaced this timeless capitalist exchange with a shallow
    collectivist alternative: <em>I'll pay attention to what you say if you
    pay attention to what I say - regardless of value</em>.
