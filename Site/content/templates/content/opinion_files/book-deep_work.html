   <h2 class="mui--text-center">The Introduction</h2>
   <p>
    Published in 2016, the book
     <a href="https://amzn.to/2Sfi49g" class="document-title" target="_blank">
      Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World</a>
     by Cal Newport is bold and daring in its view of today's
     popular culture.
   </p>
   <p>
    Dr. Newport, who earned his Doctorate from
     the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
     now is an Associate Professor at Georgetown University,
     sees most people as being on automatic pilot.
    Most of us are bobbing through life, lost in
     shallow social networks when we could be
     more mindful of our opportunities, taking
     control of our lives, and producing something
     of real value.
   </p>
   <h4 class="mui--text-center">Deep Work</h4>
   <p>
    It's essential to read the book's introduction, because it
     is where Dr. Newport defines what he means by the term
     <q class="document-title">deep work.</q>
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    Deep Work: Professional work performed in a state of
     distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive
     capabilities to their limit.
    These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and
     are hard to duplicate.
    <br>
    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Deep Work by Cal Newport, p. 3.
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Cal Newport considers the work of notables such as
     Carl Jung, Mark Twain, Woody Allen, Bill Gates, and
     J. K. Rowling to be perfect examples of the value of
     being able to work deeply.
    He describes how each of these famous people have
     taken measures to shut out distractions to achieve
     their goal of producing something of real value.
   </p>
   <p>
    Given the benefits, we would think that bosses
     would encourage deep work.
    This rarely happens, though, due to what Dr. Newport calls the
     <q class="italic">metric black hole.</q>
    Because the results of deep work are frequently invisible,
     it is difficult to measure the results.
   </p>
   <h4 class="mui--text-center">Shallow Work</h4>
   <p>
    The book cites current authors such as Nicholas Carr,
     William Powers, John Freeman, and Alex Soojung-Kin Pang
     who have written recently about how being constantly
     connected online is ruining our ability to concentrate
     on difficult problems.
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks,
     often performed while distracted.
    These efforts tend to not create much new value in the
     world and are easy to replicate.
    <br>
    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Deep Work by Cal Newport, p. 6.
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    When work does
     <q class="from-document">not create much new value</q>&nbsp;
     and is
     <q class="from-document">easy to replicate,</q>&nbsp;
     the people who do it become a commodity.
    The trend towards shallow work makes occupations that used to
     be careers become increasingly easy to outsource,
     automate &mdash; and even eliminate.
   </p>
   <h2 class="mui--text-center">The Book</h2>
   <p>
    Cal Newport describes his book as his
     <q class="from-document">attempt to formalize and explain
      my attraction to depth over shallowness.</q>
   </p>
   <p>
    The rest of the book, after the Introduction, is in two parts.
    Part 1 describes why deep work is valuable, rare, and meaningful, and
     Part 2 gives readers four rules for how to do more of it.
   </p>
   <h4 class="mui--text-center">Part 1: The Idea</h4>
   <p>
    In Chapter 1,
     <span class="document-title">Deep Work Is Valuable,</span>
     Cal Newport describes two
     abilities needed to thrive in the
     <q class="from-document">New Economy.</q>
   </p>
   <p>
    He then describes how deep work helps you
     <q class="from-document">quickly master hard things</q> and
     <q class="from-document">perform at an elite level.</q>
    It should come as no surprise that learning new things
     requires concentration, and quickly producing high-quality
     work depends on your ability to focus.
   </p>
   <p>
    What might be surprising is, studies show short interruptions
     take a higher toll than we might think.
    Taking care of a quick work obligation &mdash; or a temptation,
     like checking email or a social network site &mdash;
     lasts longter than we might think.
    The studies show a <q class="italic">residue</q> of
     these interruptions remains after the emergency is resoloved,
     or the lapse of self-discipline passes.
   </p>
   <p>
    In Chapter 2,
     <span class="document-title">Deep Work Is Rare,</span>
     Cal Newport boldly takes on current trends such as shared
     desks and open office plans, the need to maintain a presence
     on social media, and instant messaging.
   </p>
   <p>
    Early in the chapter, Dr. Newport describes the
     <q class="italic">metric black hole</q> and how complicated
     it is to answer even a seemingly simple question such as
     <q class="italic">What's the impact of our current e-mail
      habits on the bottom line?</q>
    He calls current thinking a
     <q class="from-document">culture of connectivity</q>&nbsp;
     that embraces the new, decidedly unconscious, self-assured
     <a href="/about" title="Read about corn-pone and non-corn-pone opinions">
      corn-pone opinion</a>
     that many of today's knowledge workers are
     <q class="from-document">expected to respond to e-mails
      (and related communication) quickly.</q>
   </p>
   <p>
    Newport goes on to describe how embracing the internet has
     become cult-like, and anything having to do with high-tech is
     assumed to be good.
    This sort of culture is a <q class="from-document">technopoly</q>
     where people use the internet unquestioningly &mdash; much to the
     dismay of those of us who crave to work deeply.
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
     Deep work is at a severe disadvantage in a technopoly because it builds on
     values like quality, craftmanship, and mastery that are decidedly old-fashioned
     and non-technological.
     <br>
     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Deep Work by Cal Newport, p. 69.
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    In Chapter 3,
     <span class="document-title">Deep Work Is Meaningful,</span>
     Cal Newport continues exploring the theme of craftmanship
     by introducing Ric Furrer, who uses midieval techniques to
     make swords.
    A master craftsman, Furrer explains he doesn't
     <q class="from-document">need a sword,</q> but feels
     compelled <q class="from-document">to make them.</q>
   </p>
   <p>
    For readers who remain unconvinced of the value of deep work,
     Dr. Newport proceeds to detail three arguments supporting it.
   </p>
   <p>
    His neurological argument contends our worlds are defined by
     <q class="from-document">what we pay attention to.</q>
    His psychological argument cites studies finding we are
     happier when working in a state of flow &mdash; deep
     concentration &mdash; than we are when relaxing.
    And his philosophical argument maintains our modern,
     nihilist lives are largely devoid of meaning,
     and one way we can find meaning is by embracing
     craftmanship, which involves working deeply.
   </p>
   <h4 class="mui--text-center">Part 2: The Rules</h4>
   <p>
    Part 2 comprises the remainder of the book, and accounts
     for close to two-thirds of it.
   </p>
   <p>
    This part contains four chapters, each named for one of
     the rules Dr. Newport prescribes for those of us who
     want to put his theories into practice:
   </p>
   <ul class="toms-collection">
    <li class="toms-collection-item">
     <span class="document-title">Rule #1: Work Deeply</span>
      spans 59 pages and presents four strategies for
      scheduling deep work, discusses ritualizing it and
      making grand gestures, and suggests four disciplines
      for implementing your deep work strategy
    </li>
    <li class="toms-collection-item">
     <span class="document-title">Rule #2: Embrace Boredom</span>
      runs 25 pages and is about training yourself to focus by
      embracing boredom &mdash; rather than your smart phone &mdash;
      when waiting in line, and practicing
      <q class="from-document">productive meditation</q>&nbsp;
      by exercising your ability to focus while doing mindless
      tasks like driving, chores, walking, and showering
    </li>
    <li class="toms-collection-item">
     <span class="document-title">Rule #3: Quit Social Media</span>
     is 44 pages long and explains in plain language what many of
     us already know, if not consciously certainly subconsciously
     &mdash; as exemplified by the quotes below &mdash; and includes
     strategies for cutting back or quitting one or more of these
     addictive sites completely
    </li>
    <li class="toms-collection-item">
     <span class="document-title">Rule #4: Drain the Shallows</span>
     spends the last 41 pages of the book ______________
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Rather than get into any deeper details about Part 2 here,
     I will close off this section with a couple of my favorite
     quotes from the book, from
     <span class="document-title">Rule #3: Quit Social Media:</span>
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    [Social networking sites] offer personalized information arriving on an
    unpredictible intermittent schedule - making them massively addictive and
    therefore capable of severely damaging your attempts to schedule and
    succeed with any act of concentration.
    <br>
    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Deep Work by Cal Newport, p. 205.
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Then, on the very next page:
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    But part of what makes social networking insidious is that the companies
    that profit from your attention have succeeded with a masterful marketing
    coup: convincing our culture that if you don't use their products you
    might <u>miss out</u>.
    <br>

    If you're interested in more, you should definitely
     <a href="https://amzn.to/2Sfi49g" target="_blank">
      buy the book</a>
     and read it for yourself, because it is full of this sort of
     assumption-busting,

   <h2 class="mui--text-center">My Take</h2>
   <p>
    Having somehow hit my limit with social networking when Trump
     fired Comey, at first I thought I could skip the third chapter in this part,
     Quit Social Networking.
   </p>
   <p>
    Deciding to read the chapter anyway, I learned there was more behind my
     frustration with social networking than the president's
     penchant for firing people.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    What if I told you the technopoly has duped us into
     thinking we need to use the internet <em>else fomo</em>?

   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is
     becoming increasingly <em>rare</em> at exactly the same time it is
     becoming increasingly <em>valuable</em> in our economy.
    As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make
     it the core of their working life, will thrive.

    [Cal discusses how before the internet, traditional media - books,
    newspapers, radio, film, tv - were heavily curated by the publishers.
    Using social media, anyone can publish anything without fear of an
    editor's modifications.  Examples: songs such as The Pill and Wake Up,
    Little Susie, The Hayes Code, Uhura's and Kirk's kiss, and so on.]
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    Part of what fueled social media's rapid ascent, I contend, is its ability
    to short-circuit this connection between the hard work of producing real
    value and the positive reward of having people pay attention to you. It has
    instead replaced this timeless capitalist exchange with a shallow
    collectivist alternative: <em>I'll pay attention to what you say if you
    pay attention to what I say - regardless of value</em>.
