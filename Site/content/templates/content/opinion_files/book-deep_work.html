   <h2 class="mui--text-center">The Introduction</h2>
   <p>
    Published in 2016, the book
     <a href="https://amzn.to/2Sfi49g" target="_blank">
      Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World</a>
     by Cal Newport is bold and daring in its view of today's
     popular culture.
   </p>
   <p>
    Dr. Newport, who earned his Doctorate from
     the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
     now is an Associate Professor at Georgetown University,
     sees most people as being on automatic pilot.
    Most of us are bobbing through life, lost in
     shallow social networks when we could be
     more mindful of our opportunities, taking
     control of our lives, and producing something
     of real value.
   </p>
   <h4 class="mui--text-center">Deep Work</h4>
   <p>
    It's essential to read the book's introduction, because it
     is where he defines deep work.
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    Deep Work: Professional work performed in a state of
     distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive
     capabilities to their limit.
    These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and
     are hard to duplicate.
    <br>
    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Deep Work by Cal Newport, p. 3.
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Cal Newport considers the work of people such as
     Carl Jung, Mark Twain, Woody Allen, Bill Gates, and
     J. K. Rowling as examples of the value of
     being able to work deeply.
   </p>
   <p>
    Given the benefits, we would think that bosses
     would encourage deep work.
    This rarely happens, though, due to what Dr. Newport calls the
     <q class="italic">metric black hole.</q>
    Because the results of deep work are frequently invisible,
     it is difficult to measure the results.
   </p>
   <h4 class="mui--text-center">Shallow Work</h4>
   <p>
    The book cites current authors such as Nicholas Carr,
     William Powers, John Freeman, and Alex Soojung-Kin Pang
     who have written recently about how being constantly
     connected online is ruining our ability to concentrate
     on difficult problems.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks,
     often performed while distracted.
    These efforts tend to not create much new value in the
     world and are easy to replicate.
    <br>
    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Deep Work by Cal Newport, p. 6.
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Because shallow work does
     <q class="from-document">not create much new value</q>&nbsp;
     and is
     <q class="from-document">easy to replicate,</q>&nbsp;
     it is also easy to outsource, automate &mdash; and even eliminate.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is
     becoming increasingly <em>rare</em> at exactly the same time it is
     becoming increasingly <em>valuable</em> in our economy.
    As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make
     it the core of their working life, will thrive.

   <h2 class="mui--text-center">The Book</h2>
   <p>
    The rest of book is in two parts.
    Part 1 defines what deep work is, and
     Part 2 details how to do more of it.

   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
     Deep work is at a severe disadvantage in a technopoly because it builds on
     values like quality, craftmanship, and mastery that are decidedly old-fashioned
     and non-technological.
     <br>
     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Deep Work by Cal Newport, p. 69.
   </blockquote>
   <p>
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    [Social networking sites] offer personalized information arriving on an
    unpredictible intermittent schedule - making them massively addictive and
    therefore capable of severely damaging your attempts to schedule and
    succeed with any act of concentration.
    <br>
    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Deep Work by Cal Newport, p. 205.
   </blockquote>
   <p>
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    But part of what makes social networking insidious is that the companies
    that profit from your attention have succeeded with a masterful marketing
    coup: convincing our culture that if you don't use their products you
    might <em>miss out</em>.

    [Cal discusses how before the internet, traditional media - books,
    newspapers, radio, film, tv - were heavily curated by the publishers.
    Using social media, anyone can publish anything without fear of an
    editor's modifications.  Examples: songs such as The Pill and Wake Up,
    Little Susie, The Hayes Code, Uhura's and Kirk's kiss, and so on.]
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    Part of what fueled social media's rapid ascent, I contend, is its ability
    to short-circuit this connection between the hard work of producing real
    value and the positive reward of having people pay attention to you. It has
    instead replaced this timeless capitalist exchange with a shallow
    collectivist alternative: <em>I'll pay attention to what you say if you
    pay attention to what I say - regardless of value</em>.
