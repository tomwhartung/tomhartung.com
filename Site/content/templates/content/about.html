   <p>
    To understand what non-corn-pone opinions are, you must
     first understand what corn-pone opinions are.
   </p>
   <h2 class="mui--text-center">Corn-Pone Opinions</h2>
   <p>
    <span class="document-title">Corn-Pone Opinions</span> is the name of
     an essay Samuel Clemmens wrote under his pen name
     <a href="https://seeourminds.com/image/0500-real-famous-american-celebrities/0500/"
        title="Spiritual portrait of Mark Twain at seeourminds.com" target="_blank">
      Mark Twain</a>.
    First published in 1923, the short essay is
     <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=corn+pone+opinions+pdf&oq=corn+pone+opinions+pdf"
        title="search google for 'corn pone opinions pdf'" target="_blank">
      easy to find online</a>.
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="document-title">Corn-Pone Opinions</span>
     describes an experience Twain had as a teenager
     living in a town on the banks of the Mississippi, years before
     the outbreak of the Civil War.
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    I had a friend whose society was very dear to me because I
     was forbidden by my mother to partake of it.
    He was a gay and impudent and satirical and delightful young
     black man &mdash; a slave &mdash; who daily preached sermons
     from the top of his master's woodpile, with me for sole audience.
     <br>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From
     <span class="document-title">Corn-Pone Opinions</span> by Mark Twin, 1923.
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Early on in the essay, Twain quotes his friend, the
     <q class="from-document">black philosopher:</q>
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    <q class="">You tell me whar a man gits his corn pone,
      en I'll tell you what his 'pinions is.</q>
      <br>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
      <span class="document-title">Corn-Pone Opinions</span>.
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    This of course begs the question:
   </p>
   <h4 class="mui--text-center">WTF Is Corn-Pone?</h4>
   <p>
    Corn-pone is used to make corn bread and it was an essential
     foodstuff in the 1850s.
   </p>
   <p>
    In Twain's essay, though, corn-pone represents a specific type of
     <span class="from-document">self-approval</span>.
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    Self-approval is acquired mainly from the approval of other people.
    The result is conformity.
    Sometimes conformity has a sordid business interest &mdash;
     the bread-and-butter interest &mdash; but not in most cases, I think.
    I think that <u><b>in the majority of cases it is unconscious and
     not calculated.</b></u>
    <br>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
    <span class="document-title">Corn-Pone Opinions</span>.
    [Emphasis added.]
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Corn-pone opinions are safe, conventional, and not worth sharing.
   </p>
   <h2 class="mui--text-center">Non-Corn-Pone Opinions</h2>
   <p>
    The opposite of corn-pone opinions, <em>non-corn-pone opinions
     are unconventional opinions.</em>
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-breakout">
    The thing about it is, dear reader, writing safe, conventional,
     corn-pone opinions is a waste of time, because
     <q>everyone</q> already agrees with those.
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Worse,
     <q><span class="from-document">in the majority of
       cases it is unconscious and not calculated.</span></q>
   </p>
   <h4 class="mui--text-center">Ground Rule</h4>
   <p>
    The rule here is, I can't care what you,
     or anyone else for that matter, thinks about my
     non-corn-pone opinions.
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-breakout">
    Looking for approval for my non-corn-pone opinions
     from anyone other than myself would make them
     corn-pone opinions!
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Yikes, I wouldn't want to do that!!
   </p>
   <h4 class="mui--text-center">Context</h4>
   <p>
    Non-corn-pone opinions, like their corn-pone counter parts,
     are of course contextual:
     they can vary over time and from place to place.
   </p>
   <p>
    I live in Five Points, in Central Denver, Colorado, USA, and
     have been getting my corn-pone from the
     <q class="italic">UnSafeway</q> for nigh on 25 years now.
    Colorado is great: it's neither north nor south, nor east
     nor west.
    I grew up in Richmond Virginia, and spent about two years in LA.
   </p>
   <p>
    Denver Colorado is not too big, and it's not too small:
     it's just exactly perfect!
   </p>
   <p>
    Unfortunately, though, we're full, so don't move here.
    Thanks!
   </p>
   <p>
    Now you know where I &mdash; and my corn-pone &mdash;
     are coming from.
    Just so you know!
   </p>
   <h2 class="mui--text-center">Politics &ndash; A Perfect Example</h2>
   <p>
    As I write this in 2018, the two-party system in America
     has made politics farcical.
    Interestingly, Twain saw this sort of thing a hundred years ago:
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    [W]e know why Catholics are Catholics; why Presbyterians
     are Presbyterians; why Baptists are Baptists;
     why Mormons are Mormons; why thieves are thieves;
     why monarchists are monarchists;
     why Republicans are Republicans and Democrats, Democrats.
    We know it is a matter of association and sympathy,
     not reasoning and examination; that hardly a man in the world
     has an opinion upon morals, politics, or religion which
     he got otherwise than through his associations and sympathies.
    <br>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
    <span class="document-title">Corn-Pone Opinions</span>.
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Eating citified corn-pone makes people liberal, and
     liberals take views that are predictably liberal.
   </p>
   <p>
    Eating countrified corn-pone makes people conservative, and
     conservatives take views that are predictably conservative.
   </p>
   <h4 class="mui--text-center">Finding a Formula</h4>
   <p>
    When it comes to finding a formula for devising non-corn-pone
     opinions, the blending of the two, such as it is, in the
     suburbs and on the internet is not a concern.
    People are uniformly pissed off these days and more often than not
     willing to self-identify when pressed in any manner.
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    Men think they think upon great political questions, and they do; but they
     think with their party, not independently....
    They swarm with their party, they feel with their party,
     they are happy in their party's approval; and where the
     party leads they will follow, whether for right and honor,
     or through blood and dirt and a mush of mutilated morals.
    <br>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
    <span class="document-title">Corn-Pone Opinions</span>.
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Despite the mixing of contexts that occurs online, which can
     be quite entertaining &mdash; in a tragic&ndash;comic
     sort of way &mdash; this divisiveness makes coming up with a
     non-corn-pone opinion a total no-brainer.
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-breakout">
    A political opinion can be <u>non</u>-corn-pone by simply being
     <u>both liberal and conservative simultaneously</u> &mdash;
     or by being <u>neither liberal nor conservative.</u>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Former FBI Director James Comey is on the right track in
     his article
     <q class="document-title"><a href="https://medium.com/wordsthatmatter/why-truth-is-james-comey-s-word-of-the-year-726e99434d6c"
        title="Article by James Comey on medium.com"
        target="_blank">Why
      ‘Truth’ Is James Comey’s Word of the Year</a></q>
     &mdash; but there are probably plenty who will claim
     he fell short of the mark because he didn't take a jab at
     one or both of the Clintons.
   </p>
   <p>
    Well, pfft.  Nobody's perfect.
   </p>
   <h4 class="mui--text-center">Don't Assume!</h4>
   <p>
    This is not to say this site is full of non-partisan or bi-partisan
     opinions!
   </p>
   <p>
    I am just saying:
   </p>
   <ul class="toms-collection">
    <li class="toms-collection-item">
     Politics provides a huge stream of ready-made opinions,
      corn-pone-y and non-corn-pone-y alike
    </li>
    <li class="toms-collection-item">
     Today's divisive political climate provides us with a no-brainer
      formula for forming non-corn-pone opinions
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Make no mistake, the focus of this site is
     <em><u>not</u> the content of this or that opinion,</em>
     but rather the fact that &mdash; as Twain
     puts it in his essay &mdash;
     <q><span class="from-document">in the majority of
       cases it is unconscious and not calculated.</span></q>
   </p>
   <h2 class="mui--text-center">Out, Damn'd Assumption!</h2>
   <p>
    What if I told you that the only reason you cannot travel in time
     is because you think you can't?
   </p>
   <h4 class="mui--text-center">Eggs</h4>
   <p>
    First eggs were good, a staple of a modern breakfast.
    Then some researchers learned about cholesterol and
     suddenly eggs were bad.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then some marketers wanted more money and
     decided they were good again.
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-breakout">
    If you're confused, now you can compromise and just eat the whites.

   </p>
   <h4 class="mui--text-center">Rock 'n' Roll's Boring Parents</h4>
   <p>
    First there was jazz and R&B music for the black people,
     and popular and country music for white people.
    People played their music at home, and never the twain did meet.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then the radio came along and the kids started listening to
     both types of music &mdash; and Rock 'n' Roll was born!
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-breakout">
    Dumping your assumptions can be quite liberating!
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    And sometimes a compromise &mdash; as in the case of the
     egg whites &mdash; can be easily found.
   </p>
   <h4 class="mui--text-center">Assumptions Are Stubborn Things</h4>
