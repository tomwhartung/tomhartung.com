   <p>
    To understand what non-corn-pone opinions are, you must
     first understand what corn-pone opinions are.
   </p>
   <h2 class="mui--text-center">Corn-Pone Opinions</h2>
   <p>
    <span class="document-title">Corn-Pone Opinions</span> is the name of
     an essay Samuel Clemmens wrote under his pen name
     <a href="https://seeourminds.com/image/0500-real-famous-american-celebrities/0500/"
        title="Spiritual portrait of Mark Twain at seeourminds.com" target="_blank">
      Mark Twain</a>.
    First published in 1923, the short essay is

   <p>
    <span class="document-title">Corn-Pone Opinions</span>
     describes an experience Twain had as a teenager
     living in a town on the banks of the Mississippi, years before
     the outbreak of the Civil War.
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    I had a friend whose society was very dear to me because I
     was forbidden by my mother to partake of it.
    He was a gay and impudent and satirical and delightful young
     black man &mdash; a slave &mdash; who daily preached sermons
     from the top of his master's woodpile, with me for sole audience.
     <br>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From
     <span class="document-title">Corn-Pone Opinions</span> by Mark Twin, 1923.
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Early on in the essay, Twain quotes his friend, the
     <q class="from-document">black philosopher:</q>
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    <q class="">You tell me whar a man gits his corn pone,
      en I'll tell you what his 'pinions is.</q>
      <br>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
      <span class="document-title">Corn-Pone Opinions</span>.
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Corn-pone is used to make corn bread and it was an essential
     foodstuff in the 1850s.
   </p>
   <p>
    In Twain's essay, though, corn-pone represents a specific type of
     <span class="from-document">self-approval</span>.
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    Self-approval is acquired mainly from the approval of other people.
    The result is conformity.
    Sometimes conformity has a sordid business interest &mdash;
     the bread-and-butter interest &mdash; but not in most cases, I think.
    I think that in the majority of cases it is unconscious and
     not calculated.
    <br>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;

   <p>
    Corn-pone opinions are safe, conventional, and not worth sharing.
   </p>
   <h2 class="mui--text-center">Non-Corn-Pone Opinions</h2>
   <p>
    Non-corn-pone opinions are unconventional opinions.
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-breakout">
    The thing about it is, dear reader, writing safe, conventional,
     corn-pone opinions is a waste of time, because
     <q>everyone</q> already agrees with those.
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Worse,
     <q><span class="from-document">in the majority of
       cases it is unconscious and not calculated.</span></q>
   </p>
   <h3 class="mui--text-center">Ground Rule</h3>
   <p>
    The rule here is, I can't care what you,
     or anyone else for that matter, thinks about my
     non-corn-pone opinions.
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-breakout">
    Looking for approval for my non-corn-pone opinions
     from anyone other than myself would make them
     corn-pone opinions!
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Yikes, I wouldn't want to do that!!
   </p>
   <h3 class="mui--text-center">Context</h3>
   <p>
    Non-corn-pone opinions, like their corn-pone counter parts,
     are of course contextual:
     they can vary over time and from place to place.
   </p>
   <p>
    I live in Five Points, in Denver, Colorado, USA, and
     have been getting my corn-pone from the
     <q class="italic">UnSafeway</q> for nigh on 25 years now.
   </p>
   <p>
    Now you know where I &mdash; and my corn-pone &mdash;
     are coming from!
   </p>
   <h2 class="mui--text-center">Why?</h2>
   <p>
    <q class="italic">Why,</q> I can hear you ask.
     <q class="italic bold">Why?</q>
   </p>
   <h3 class="mui--text-center">Corn-Pone Party Politics</h3>
   <p>
    I'll tell you why:
     <em><b>I am fed up with the two-party politics in this country!</b></em>
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    [W]e know ... why Republicans are Republicans and Democrats, Democrats.
    We know it is a matter of association and sympathy,
     not reasoning and examination; that hardly a man in the world
     has an opinion upon morals, politics, or religion which
     he got otherwise than through his associations and sympathies.
    <br>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
    <span class="document-title">Corn-Pone Opinions</span>.
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    I am sick and tired of liberals acting predictably liberal and
     conservatives acting predictably conservative.
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    Men think they think upon great political questions, and they do; but they
     think with their party, not independently....
    They swarm with their party, they feel with their party,
     they are happy in their party's approval; and where the
     party leads they will follow, whether for right and honor,
     or through blood and dirt and a mush of mutilated morals.

    Alexander Hamilton sums it up like so:
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    Men often oppose a thing, merely because they have had no agency in
     planning it, or because it may have been planned by those whom they dislike.
    <br>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
    Alexander Hamilton, as Publius in
     <b>Federalist No. 70, The Executive Department Further Considered</b>,
     March 18, 1788.
