    This django site uses MUI CSS:
   </p>
   <ul class="toms-collection">
    <li class="toms-collection-item">
     <a href='https://www.muicss.com/' target='_blank'>
      https://www.muicss.com/</a>

   <h3 class="mui--text-center">Template</h3>
   <p>
			 MUI CSS is a very light-weight css library.

    Mohammedans are Mohammedans because they are born and reared among that
    sect, not because they have thought it out and can furnish sound reasons for
    being Mohammedans; we know why Catholics are Catholics; why Presbyterians
    are Presbyterians; why Baptists are Baptists; why Mormons are Mormons; why
    thieves are thieves; why monarchists are monarchists; why Republicans are
    Republicans and Democrats, Democrats. We know it is a matter of association
    and sympathy, not reasoning and examination; that hardly a man in the world
    has an opinion upon morals, politics, or religion which he got otherwise than
    through his associations and sympathies.

    Decades before Twain's observations, Alexander Hamilton
     saw the same sort of predictable, safe, conventional corn-pone thinking:
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    Men often oppose a thing, merely because they have had no agency in
     planning it, or because it may have been planned by those whom they dislike.
    <br>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
    Alexander Hamilton, as Publius in
     <u>Federalist No. 70, The Executive Department Further Considered</u>,
     March 18, 1788.

    A political opinion can be <u>non</u>-corn-pone by simply being
     <u>both liberal and conservative simultaneously</u> &mdash;
     or by being <u>neither liberal nor conservative.</u>
   </p>
   <p>
    Despite the mixing of contexts that occurs online, which can
     be quite entertaining &mdash; in a tragic&ndash;comic
     sort of way &mdash; this divisiveness makes coming up with a
     non-corn-pone opinion a total no-brainer.

   <h4 class="mui--text-center">Rock 'n' Roll's Boring Parents</h4>
   <p>
    First there was jazz and R&B music for the black people,
     and popular and country music for white people.
    People played their music at home, and never the twain did meet.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then the radio came along and the kids started listening to
     both types of music &mdash; and Rock 'n' Roll was born!
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-breakout">
    Dumping your assumptions can be quite liberating!
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    And sometimes a compromise &mdash; as in the case of the
     egg whites &mdash; can be easily found.

    "What if I told you"s are always fun:
