    This django site uses MUI CSS:

   <ul class="toms-collection">
    <li class="toms-collection-item">
     <a href='https://www.muicss.com/' target='_blank'>
      https://www.muicss.com/</a>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
			 MUI CSS is a very light-weight css library.

   <h2>Extra Content Found Lying Around</h2>

    Decades before Twain's observations, Alexander Hamilton
     saw the same sort of predictable, safe, conventional corn-pone thinking:
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
    Men often oppose a thing, merely because they have had no agency in
     planning it, or because it may have been planned by those whom they dislike.
    <br>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
    Alexander Hamilton, as Publius in
     <u>Federalist No. 70, The Executive Department Further Considered</u>,
     March 18, 1788.
   </blockquote>
   <h4 class="mui--text-center">Rock 'n' Roll's Boring Parents</h4>
   <p>
    First there was jazz and R&B music for the black people,
     and popular and country music for white people.
    People played their music at home, and never the twain did meet.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then the radio came along and the kids started listening to
     both types of music &mdash; and Rock 'n' Roll was born!
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-breakout">
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    And sometimes a compromise &mdash; as in the case of the
     egg whites &mdash; can be easily found.
   </p>
   <p>
    "What if I told you"s are always fun:
   </p>
   <blockquote class="toms-breakout">
    What if I told you that full-time jobs will soon be as obsolete
     as the family farm?
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Never gets old!
