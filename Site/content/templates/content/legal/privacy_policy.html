    <h5>Log Files</h5>
    <p>
     Like many other Web sites, this site makes use of log files.
     These files log when someone visits the site, are typical for any computer
      that hosts a web site, may help with maintenance of the site, and
      contribute to the site's analytics.</p>
    <p>
     The information inside these log files typically includes internet protocol
      (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and time
      stamp, and referring pages.
     This information can be used to analyze trends, administer the site, track
      a user's movement around the site, and gather demographic information.
     None of this information is knowingly linked to any personally identifiable
      information.</p>
    <h5>Removing Usage Data</h5>
    <p>
     Collecting usage data is part of how the internet works.
     Note that <b>once it is logged, removing this usage data is problematic</b>.</p>
    <p>
     If you are uncomfortable with this, you can
      <b>prevent the collection of <em>some</em> of this data by following
       these suggestions:</b></p>

    <p>
     The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method

     While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your
      personal data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

    <h3 class="center">Service Providers</h3>
    <p>
     We employ third party companies and individuals, known as <q>service providers,</q>
      to help provide the website on our behalf, to monitor the performance of our
      website, to perform website-related services, and to assist us in
      analyzing how visitors use our website.</p>
    <p>
     These third parties have access to your personal data only to perform these
      tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any
      other purpose.</p>
    <h4>Hosting and Other Cloud Services</h4>
    <p>
     In an effort to keep our operating costs low, we may use third-party service
      providers to host and provide other services needed to run our website.
     These providers may include one or more of the following:</p>
    <ul class="collection">
     <li class="collection-item">Forethought.net</li>
     <li class="collection-item">Google Cloud Services</li>
     <li class="collection-item">Amazon Web Services</li>
     <li class="collection-item">Digital Ocean</li>
     <li class="collection-item">Azure</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     Because the pricing and availability of these services is constantly changing,
      and many factors in addition to pricing and availability, such as reliability
      and ease of maintenance are important to us, there is no guarantee that we
      are using any one of these, or that this list is complete, at any given moment.</p>
    <p>
     Each of these providers has their own privacy policy, and we encourage you
      to familiarize yourself with the privacy policies of all of them.
     Note that many websites use these providers.

    <a name="analytics"></a>
    <h4>Analytics</h4>
    <p>We use third-party service providers, such as Google, to monitor and analyze the use of our website.</p>
    <h5>Google Analytics</h5>
    <p>
     Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks
      and reports website traffic.
     Google Analytics uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of
      our website and shares this data among various other Google services.
     Under certain circumstances, Google may use the collected data to contextualize
      and personalize the ads of its own advertising network.</p>
    <p>
     You can opt-out of making your activity on the website available to Google
      Analytics by installing the
      <a href='https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout' target='_blank'
         title='Link to a page about the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on at tools.google.com'>
       Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a>,
      which <q>is designed to be compatible with Chrome, Internet Explorer 11,
      Safari, Firefox and Opera</q>.
     The add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js,
      and dc.js) from sharing information with Google Analytics about visits activity.</p>
    <h4>Advertising and Affiliate Marketing</h4>
    <p>
     In an effort to recoup the time and money invested in creating and
      maintaining this site, some pages on the website may contain ads, and
      some of the content on the website may contain affiliate marketing links.</p>
    <p>
     These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology in their advertisements
      and links that appear on this website.
     This technology includes <a href="#cookies">cookies</a> which may be sent
      to your browser when you visit our site.</p>
    <p>
     These third-party ad services automatically receive your IP address when
      this occurs.
     Other technologies in addition to cookies, such as JavaScript or Web Beacons,
      may also be used by our website's third-party ad networks to measure the
      effectiveness of their advertising campaigns, or to personalize the
      advertising content that you see on the site, or both.</p>
    <p>
     We have no access to or control over the cookies used by third-party
      advertisers, and it is safe to assume that the use of these technoligies is
      constantly changing, with a tendency towards getting increasingly sophisticated.
     Each of these advertisers has their own Privacy Policy, and we encourage you
      to familiarize yourself with the privacy policies of all of them.</p>
    <p>
     To learn how you can control some of the technology used in advertising,
      see the section about
      <a href="#controlling-preferences">Controlling Your Ad Preferences</a>
     in this document.</p>
    <h5>Google AdSense</h5>
    <p>
     This website may serve ads using Google AdSense.
     Google AdSense is a sophisticated advertising tool with its own privacy
      concerns and policies.</p>
    <p>
     Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a
      user's prior visits to your website or other websites.
     Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads
      to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the
     Internet.</p>
    <p>
     To learn how to control your preferences for ads from google and other sources,

    <h5>Affiliate Marketing</h5>
    <p>
     The internet gives us an opportunity to share our opinions about products
      we like and recommend them to visitors.
     In some cases, we partner with merchants, known as <q>affiliates,</q>
      and we sometimes use links they provide in some of our content.
     In some of these cases these merchants reimburse us for these referrals.</p>
    <p>
     This type of reimbursement for our work in sharing our recommendations is
      known as <q><em>affiliate marketing,</em></q> and it helps us recoup some of the
      investment we have made in creating, providing, and maintaining this website.</p>
    <p>
     Following is a partial list of the companies with which we have an
      affiliate marketing relationship:</p>
    <ul class="collection">
     <li class="collection-item">Amazon</li>
     <li class="collection-item">Commission Junction</li>
     <li class="collection-item">ShareASale</li>
